PWAs (Progressive Web Apps) are also becoming more popular due to having the look and feel of naitve apps but being easier and cheaper to develop and maintain, can be installed on the users device and used offline and are automatically updated alongside their web counterpart. 

This project aims to develop a simple On-Demand Rental PWA using React. 

Ideas include: 
    - Bicycle/Car/Scooter Rental 
    - Drone Rental
    - (Endless options!)
